# Brain-Tumor-Detection
| MATLAB project |

Objective :
Using segmented MRI brain images, perform feature extraction to generate GLCM (gray level co-occurrence matrix) and training the model using ANN. Lastly Using SVM to classify the tumor as malignant or benign.

Role :

• Studied various white papers and did literary survey on the topic.
• Performed Pre-Processing
▪ RGB to Gray to Binary
▪ Image Resizing
▪ Contrast Enhancement using histogram equalization.
▪ Noise-Filtering
• Performed feature extraction using GLCM (Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix) to get
features like Energy, Contrast, Homogeneity, Correlation, Shade etc.
• Normalized the numerical feature variables.
• Used k-means to cluster different feature classes.
• Trained the model using ANN to Classify Tumor as Benign or Malignant.
• Used Confusion matrix to validate model performance and model accuracy.
• Prepared analysis summary document

Motivation : Early detection of brain tumor is decisive in getting a positive prognosis. MRI images is a feasible means for early detection of Brain tumor.
