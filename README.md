# Brain-Tumor-Detection
| MATLAB project | Using segmented MRI brain images, perform feature extraction to generate GLCM (gray level co-occurrence matrix) and training the model using ANN. Lastly Using SVM to classify the tumor as malignant or benign.

| Motivation | Early detection of brain tumor is decisive in getting a positive prognosis. MRI images is a feasible means for early detection of Brain tumor.
